Understanding the Equipment

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.600
Brake Systems

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:09.699
Safety first.

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.232
When working in the shop,

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.499
always follow the safety guidelines

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.333
provided in service information,

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.832
tool operation manuals,

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.399
and other technical literature.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.699
To protect yourself from injury,

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:24.066
wear personal protective equipment (PPE),

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.999
dress appropriately, work professionally,

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.399
and correctly handle tools and equipment.

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.599
The modern brake system uses mechanical,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.100
hydraulic, and electronic components to slow

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.333
and stop the vehicle.

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.832
This video will introduce you to the components

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.799
and operation of the brake system.

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.066
Braking begins when the driver presses on

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:44.799
the brake pedal.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.500
The pedal is a lever,

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.032
which increases the force applied by the driver

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900
against the brake push-rod.

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:52.966
The movement of the pedal,

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.866
which is monitored by the brake pedal

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.766
position sensor, activates the brake lights.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.966
Pedal movement is also used for the antilock

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.900
brake system,

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.233
the electronic stability control system,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.033
transmission control, and other systems.

00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.566
The movement of the push-rod forces the pistons

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.199
in the master cylinder forward.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.066
This pressurizes the fluid in the cylinder.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.133
The fluid passes through the antilock brake

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.566
hydraulic control unit,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.966
which supplies the brake fluid to the calipers

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.399
and wheel cylinders located

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.933
at the wheel brake assemblies.

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.166
All modern cars and trucks have disc brakes

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.132
at the front wheels.

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:31.999
The disc brakes consist of a caliper,

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.232
a brake rotor, and brake pads.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.666
The most common type of disc brake

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.566
is the floating caliper design.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.599
When the brakes are applied,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.600
brake fluid exerts pressure against

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.233
the back of the caliper piston.

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:47.466
This causes the piston to move out of its bore.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.033
This force is applied against the inner brake pad.

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:52.899
Because the caliper floats

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.200
on its mounting hardware,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.766
the outward movement of the piston forces the

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.366
caliper body backward, which squeezes the

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.266
outer pad against the brake rotor.

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.566
The clamping action of the pads against the rotor

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.266
creates a lot of friction and heat.

00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:09.166
The friction slows the rotation of the rotor,

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:10.732
wheel, and tire,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.133
and the heat is dissipated into the air.

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.732
Another type of disc brake design uses a fixed

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:19.599
or stationary caliper. In this arrangement,

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:21.466
the caliper is bolted in place,

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:24.199
and pistons located on either side of the rotor

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.966
apply pressure against the pads.

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:28.599
This type of brake is often found in

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.166
high-performance applications.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.900
Drum brakes are an expanding-brake design.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.800
When the brakes are applied,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.700
fluid pushes the two pistons in the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.333
wheel cylinder outward.

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:41.299
This forces the brake shoes

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.466
outward against the inside of the brake drum.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:45.932
Springs pull the shoes back

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.766
when the driver releases the brake.

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:50.599
The parking brake is a mechanical or

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.100
electromechanical system

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:53.533
that locks the rear brakes

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.099
once the vehicle is parked.

00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:56.732
Until recently,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.633
most vehicles had a completely

00:02:58.633 --> 00:02:59.733
mechanical system,

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:02.432
using steel cables to connect the parking brake

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:04.599
handle or pedal to the rear brakes.

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:06.866
Many newer models

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:08.632
use electronic parking brakes.

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.266
These systems use electric motors

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:14.232
to pull the cables or to activate a parking brake

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:16.766
mechanism in the rear disc brake calipers.

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.332
The antilock brake system, or ABS,

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.666
is used to keep the wheels from staying locked,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.566
which allows the driver

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:25.732
to maintain steering control while braking.

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:28.799
Modern vehicles incorporate the ABS

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.233
with traction and stability control systems

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:33.399
to help with overall vehicle handling

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.666
and control over many different types of

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:36.599
operating conditions.

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:39.499
Now, enter the simulation

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.600
for more onbrake system components

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.500
and operation.
