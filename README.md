# SimCore
[![Build Status][jlomoglio-badge]][jlomoglio-badge-url]

> A Vue2.js Project I created as a platform for developing interactive learning modules for Cengage. 

The goal was to have a form tool that would allow their visionaries to quickly input all their narratives, quizzes along with activity and task data. Once the form was completed the data would then be output into a json file. They also needed a custom platform that would allow their junior developers to quickly and easily import the data and to give them the ability to eaily develop the modules.

Simulation modules are comprised of several activitities that each have tasks that a student must perform, such as rotating a dial to the correct reading, or dragging a probe to a drop-zone. Each activity is voice narrated and has optional closed captioning. Students receive points for each task they complete correctly.

The existing code for the application was one of the worst code sets I had ever come across. So after several meetings, I was assigned as the lead designer and was given several candidates to choose from to work on my team. Once I had my team in place, we began tearing through the old code base and designing a new platform.

## Video Demo 
In this video demo, I will walk thru what SimCore is and how I designed it. This is a session I recorded while previweing it to another development team that needed to use it.

## Documentation
I built this documentation site with jCore and it provides detailed information on how to setup and use SimCore.
